This Flutter application marked my introduction to mobile development. During my first internship, I was tasked with building a mobile app, and my mentor suggested I use Flutter alongside Firebase. The app, named _Bizbrew_, allows users to sign in and set their coffee preferences. Simple in concept, but for me, it was an eye-opening experience.

#### **Before the Internship: A Rocky Start**

Throughout my time in school, I struggled to find motivation. The projects we were assigned didn’t interest me, and as a result, I didn’t do much programming during my studies. When the time came for our internship, I felt completely unprepared. I had no idea what I was doing. Fortunately, I got the chance to work at a small company with a great mentor (I still owe him a lot).

#### **Learning Flutter and Firebase**

For this project, I had to learn Flutter from scratch. Flutter, Google’s cross-platform framework, allows developers to build apps for both iOS and Android from a single codebase. On the backend, we used Firebase—Google’s Backend as a Service. I was blown away by the tools Firebase offered. Firestore, in particular, felt like magic. The ease with which I could implement real-time functionality in Flutter was a game-changer and a breath of fresh air compared to my school experience. However, as someone new to programming, it took me quite a while to grasp the fundamentals.

#### **Struggles and Growth**

Throughout development, I found myself wrestling with the fundamentals of programming. Concepts like classes, components, and code structure were completely new to me. I had to learn everything on the fly—how to use Git, work with the terminal, and organize my code effectively. It was overwhelming at times, but I kept pushing forward, taking it one step at a time.

#### **The Final Product**

If you were to look at the app I built, you'd see a buggy, unfinished product with a lot of rough edges. However, this project stands out to me as one of my most memorable, despite its imperfections. Why? Because it taught me the power of just starting. With a mentor to guide you and the determination to put in the work, you can build something. And that’s exactly what I did—I built something. This project laid the foundation for everything I would go on to build in the future.
