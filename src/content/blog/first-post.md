This is my first post. I hope you like it. I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build) to build this blog.

### Why choose Astro over another web framework?

Astro was designed for building content-rich websites. This include Blogs and portfolios.

By contrast, most modern web frameworks like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) are designed for building web applications. These frameworks work best for building more complex, application-like experiences in the browser: logged-in admin dashboards, inboxes, social networks, todo lists.

I've try to build this blog with NextJS, but I've found that it's not the best tool for the job. I've had to do a lot of workarounds to get the blog working. I've also had to use a lot of third-party libraries to get the blog working.

August 09, 2022 Astro 1.0 is out. I've decided to give it a try. I've been impressed with the simplicity and performance of the framework. I've been able to build this blog in a few hours.

So visit the astro website and give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it too.

### What's next?

I'm also planning to write more posts about my experience with web development in general. Discovering new tools and frameworks is one of my favorite things to do. So look forward to more posts about that.

Since this is my first post and it's not much check out [books](../books) I've read recently. Maybe you'll find something interesting there.
