Simple writing is an important aspect of writing that can have a profound impact on the engagement and connection between the writer and reader. When you use ordinary words and simple sentences, your writing is easier for readers to understand. This leads to deeper engagement with your ideas as the less energy they expend on trying to understand your prose, the more they have left to focus on your thoughts.

One of the benefits of writing simply is that readers are more likely to continue reading until the end of your piece. If they find the text to be accessible, they won't struggle with it and will be more likely to finish what they started. Additionally, writing simply helps keep you honest as a writer. If you have nothing to say, it will be obvious to everyone, including you.

Another advantage of writing simply is that it has a lasting quality. The language and culture may change over time, but simple writing will still be understandable for future readers. The author of the previous article writes simply because it offends them not to. They believe that using unnecessarily complicated sentences or intellectual words seems clumsy.

To improve your writing, aim to write in a way that the ideas leap into your reader's head and they barely notice the words that got them there. Write fast, but take the time to edit and simplify your work. Consider your readers and aim to write in a way that is easy for them to understand.

Remember, writing simply doesn't mean you can't be creative or use difficult topics. But writing in a way that is easy for your readers to understand shows consideration and honesty.

## Conclusion

The benefits of writing simply are numerous and include deeper engagement with readers, honesty, lasting quality, and personal preference. It is a valuable tool for writers to engage and connect with their audience, so give it a try and see if it helps improve your writing.
